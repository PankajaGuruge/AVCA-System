## Abstract

Animal-vehicle collisions pose a significant threat worldwide, resulting in loss of life, property damage, and economic burden. This project proposes an innovative solution - an IoT-based Animal-Vehicle Collision Avoidance (AVCA) system, also known as the Smart Car. By leveraging motion detection and object recognition algorithms, this system aims to detect animals near highways in real-time, allowing vehicles to take preventive measures to avoid collisions.

## Introduction

The modern world heavily relies on transportation, particularly automobiles, for daily commuting and trade. However, highways, especially those passing through reserve areas, pose a significant risk of animal-vehicle collisions due to high vehicle speeds and wildlife crossing. Traditional methods like electric fencing have proven harmful to animals and ineffective. This project leverages IoT technology to develop a Smart Car capable of detecting and avoiding animal collisions on highways, thereby ensuring safety for both humans and wildlife.

## Significance / Rationale of the Project

The project addresses the critical issue of animal-vehicle collisions on highways, aiming to reduce fatalities and property damage. By automating collision prevention through IoT technology, the system ensures reliability and real-time updates, thus minimizing human errors. Additionally, the project promotes cost-effectiveness by eliminating the need for manual monitoring and expensive repellent methods.
